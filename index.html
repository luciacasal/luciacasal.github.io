We study the drivers of business cycle volatility differences between emerging and developed economies.  
We develop a multisector small open economy framework with heterogeneous firms and production linkages in which firms are subject to sectoral and firm-level TFP shocks and international prices shocks.  
Using sector-level data, firm-level micro data, and international trade data from various developed and emerging economies,  we quantity the relevant model-based sufficient statistics.  
We find that differences in the sectoral composition and the distribution of firms explain roughly half of the excessive business cycle volatility in emerging economies.  
Finally, we find that the contribution of international prices is sensitive to the households' preferences.

Capital accumulation and the systematic reallocation of economic activities across sectors are two of the most salient features of the process of economic development.
These two processes are interconnected through the production of capital of various types and the differences in its usage intensity across sectors. 
This information is summarized by the investment network. Our paper introduces the first harmonized measures of the investment network across countries at different 
stages of development, and proposes a theory that characterizes disparities in income per capita (and growth rates) across countries based on these connections. 
Through counterfactual exercises, we show that 54% of disparities in income per capita can be accounted for by disparities in the investment network. 
This role is mediated by the intensity of capital use in these economies and its interaction with the IO structure. 
We show that imposing a common investment structure across countries, i.e. the one observed in the US in 2014, exacerbates income disparities.
This result suggests that poorer economies may be choosing investment bundles that align with their sectorial productivities and stage of development.

<!-- I study how productivity pass-through from supplier to customer firms is affected by the strategic behavior of supplier firms with high market power. 
Empirically, I find that productivity shocks to supplier firms with high markups lead to a short-run relative decline in their customer firm’s real output. 
To shed light on the mechanisms, I document that, compared to the rest of supplier firms in the economy, those with high markups produce highly specific products, 
capture a high share of the sales to their customers, and hold longer relationships with them. I embed the empirical findings into a structural model of firm dynamics 
to understand how product differntiability of supplier firms affects their incentives to innovate, and quantify the aggregate implications for aggregate TFP and allocative efficiency.
