We study the drivers of business cycle volatility differences between emerging and developed economies.  
We develop a multisector small open economy framework with heterogeneous firms and production linkages in which firms are subject to sectoral and firm-level TFP shocks and international prices shocks.  
Using sector-level data, firm-level micro data, and international trade data from various developed and emerging economies,  we quantity the relevant model-based sufficient statistics.  
We find that differences in the sectoral composition and the distribution of firms explain roughly half of the excessive business cycle volatility in emerging economies.  
Finally, we find that the contribution of international prices is sensitive to the households' preferences.

The question of whether economic development requires a broad or focused invest- ment strategy has long been a subject of debate among academics and policymakers alike. 
Through the lens of a parsimonious multisector model augmented to multiple capital types and intersectoral trade in intermediates and investment, we show that the aggregate output 
elasticity to sectorial productivity growth and to the terms of trade in investment producing sectors depends on the characteristics of the investment network and its interplay with 
the input-output structure. This paper provides novel and harmonized measures of the in- vestment network across countries.
 Through income accounting exercises, we show that on average, 24% of income differences across countries can be accounted for by disparities in the investment network. 
At early stages of development, output elasticities to invest- ment producing sectors are most similar across sectors, and they become more disperse at later stages of development. 
Importantly, the importance of different equipment types for total investment changes with income: at early stages of development, the importance of Construction is relatively high;
 whereas at later stages of development, ICT becomes most important. Transportation contributes similarly across the development spectrum.
